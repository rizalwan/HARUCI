#Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using UCI dataset. Classifying the type of movement amongst six categories:

WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

#Details about the input data
dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window).
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity.
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used
